                      On May 10, 1775, shortly after the American Revolutionary War began, Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen led an expedition that captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in the British Province of New York.[1] Allen and Arnold were aware that Quebec was lightly defended; there were only about 600 regular troops in the entire province.

                       Arnold, who had done business in the province before the war,[3] also had intelligence that the French-speaking Canadiens would be favorably disposed toward a colonial force. Arnold and Allen each made arguments to the Second Continental Congress that Quebec could and should be taken from the British, pointing out that the British could use Quebec as a staging area for attacks down Lake Champlain and into the Hudson River valley.

                       Congress did not want to alarm the people of Quebec, and rejected these arguments.[5] In July 1775, amid concerns that the British might use Quebec as a base for military movements into New York, they changed their position, and authorized an invasion of Quebec via Lake Champlain, assigning the task to Major General Philip Schuyler of New York.
